_"I hate admitting it, but I am terrible with scheduling. I used to waste so much time emailing back and forth just to book meetings. Now I just email Cruso and forget about it."_

_"Every day was just a wall of emails—intros, founder pitches, LP requests. Scheduling felt like a second job. I CC Cruso now, and it just happens."_

_"Look, Calendly is cold. I don't want to send scheduling links to founders I want to build a real relationship with. Cruso just does that for me."_

## On Paper, Scheduling Looks Solved

Tools like Calendly make it easy to share a link and let others book time. For many transactional interactions, that's enough.

But scheduling isn't just logistics—it's part of relationship-building.

### Calendly Feels Transactional

When a founder finally agrees to meet, you don't want to send them a link. When you're nurturing an LP relationship, you want to feel personal, not automated. Calendly turns an interaction into a transaction. It's convenient, but it's not relationship-aware.

### Rescheduling Is Still a Pain

Even if you use a scheduling link, life happens:

- A founder runs over time on a call
- An LP meeting pops up last minute
- You realize you need to reshuffle the rest of your day

Rescheduling means dozens of apology emails, calendar updates, and lost context. There's no magic button to just say, "Clear my afternoon and rework everything for me."

### Calendly Solves Links, Not Workflows

Calendly handles the front door to your calendar—but it doesn't live inside your email threads, where most scheduling actually happens.

- Intros happen over email
- Founders pitch you over email
- LP updates come through email

To delegate scheduling properly, you'd need a human EA—or you burn hours every week manually handling back-and-forth.

## Why Cruso Is Different

**Calendly Solves Links. Cruso Solves Relationships.**

Cruso doesn't replace Calendly—it augments it for people who care about relationships and live in email:

- Instead of sending a link, you just CC Cruso and forget about it
- Instead of manually rescheduling, you just tell Cruso, "Shift my afternoon"
- Instead of managing context, Cruso is already part of the email thread where the relationship lives

Calendly is great for low-context, one-off bookings. Cruso is built for high-context, relationship-driven scheduling—where trust, timing, and tone matter.

| **Urgent Meeting**       | "Cruso, I need to meet with Sarah today"                         | Finds next available slot, overrides normal buffers                         |

## Why People Switch from Calendly

| With Calendly                       | With Cruso                              |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Send cold booking link              | Personal email coordination             |
| Limited to your availability        | Finds mutual availability               |
| One meeting at a time               | Handles complex multi-person scheduling |
| No context or relationship building | Maintains warm, professional tone       |
| Can't handle last-minute changes    | Instant rescheduling and communication  |
| Rigid time slots                    | Flexible, intelligent scheduling        |

## Who Cruso Is Built For

If we think about who values Cruso most, we look for people who:

- Have a high volume of inbound scheduling requests
- Have unpredictable calendars that require frequent reshuffling
- Operate in contexts where relationships matter, so a Calendly link feels cold
- Either don't have a human EA or can't fully rely on one

**The key pattern:** People who receive more requests than they send. People for whom time is leverage. People who operate in relationship-heavy, high-context interactions.

That's why VCs, founders, angels, superconnectors, and high-touch executives find Cruso essential.
